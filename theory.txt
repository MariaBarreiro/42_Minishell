Unix and Linux System administration handbook
  -> Every shell has at least three communication channels available: STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR (standard input(0), standard output(1) and standard error(2));
  -> Most commands accept their input from STDIN and write their output to STDOUT.
  -> Shell interprets symbols: 
     --> '<' connects the command's STDIN to the contents of an existing file.
     --> '>' and '>>' redirects STDOUT.
     --> '>' replaces the file's existing contents.
     --> '>>' appends to the file's existing contents.
